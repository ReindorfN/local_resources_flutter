# local_resources_flutter

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started


This applicaton is aimed at providing resources and tutorials on implementing local resources in flutter.

This project starts with an android version and thus, will focus on implementing android local resources. 

future versions might cater for and include resource implementation on iOS for iphones.

*NB:* This is for my mobile application development class.
