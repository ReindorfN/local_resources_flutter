# local_resources_flutter

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

This applicaton is aimed at providing resources and tutorials on implementing local resources in flutter.

This project starts with an android version and thus, will focus on implementing android local resources. 

futhure versions might cater for and include resource implementation on iOS for iphones.

NB: This is for my mobile application development class.
